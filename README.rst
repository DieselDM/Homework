Lab 1: RPN Calculator
#####################

You will create files and folders under this directory for the Lab 1 project.
Add files as needed then do this:

..  code-block:: bash

    $ cd Lab1_RPN_Calculator (if needed)
    $ git status
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "message"
    $ git push origin master
    $ git status

This is the sequence of commands you will use every time you stop work on the
project. WHen you reach the point where the project is ready for grading you
will notify me. I will see that and grade the project. If you need help at any
point, make sure your current code is on the Github server.
